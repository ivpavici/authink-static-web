			<p id="home-top-text">AuThink is a system designed with one main goal in mind: to help children with autism! But in order to do so, we were aware that parents and teachers who work with them can also be helped. That is why AuThink was designed bearing them in mind as well.
				<br /><br />
				We hope to help increasing the independence of children with autism in their environment, society in general, and day-to-day life through various specialized and individualized tasks (Applied behavior analysis (ABA)), authored by their teachers and parents. This is why a high level of individualization is crucial, in order to make progress and learning as easy as possible for each child, both in specialized schools and their home.
				<br /><br />
				And last but not least, AuThink aims to achieve these goals in an encouraging and educative environment!</p>
